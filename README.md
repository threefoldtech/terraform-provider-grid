# Grid provider for terraform

A terraform provider for the [threefold grid](https://threefold.io) to manage your infrastructure using terraform.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.15
- [Gettting started document](https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual3_iac/grid3_terraform/manual__grid3_terraform_home)

## Using provider for different environments

- to use the `mainnet`'s version of the provider for `v1.7.0`, use the following configs:

  ```terraform
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      grid = {
        source = "threefoldtech/grid"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- to use the `testnet`'s version of the provider for `v1.7.0`, use the following configs:

  ```terraform
  terraform{
    required_providers{
      grid = {
        source = "threeflodtech/grid"
        version = "1.7.0-rcX"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- for devnet, qanet use `<VERSION>-dev` and `<VERSION>-qa` respectivly

## Using the provider

```bash
cd examples/resources/singlenode
export MNEMONICS="mnemonics words"

terraform destroy -parallelism=1 # destroy the created resource
```
