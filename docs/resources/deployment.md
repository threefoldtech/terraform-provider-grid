## Schema

### Required

- `node_id` (Number) Node id to place the deployment on.

### Optional

- `disks` (Block List) List of disk workloads configurations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--disks))
- `name` (String) Solution name for created contract to be consistent across threefold tooling.
- `network_name` (String) Network name of the deployed network resource to connect vms.

- `vms` (Block List) List of vm (Zmachine) workloads configurations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--vms))
- `zdbs` (Block List) List of Zdb workloads configurations. You can read more about 0-db (Zdb) [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db/). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--zdbs))
