  Resource for deploying a gateway name workload.
  A user should specify some unique name and a node working as a gateway, and the grid generates a fully qualified domain name (fqdn) in the form name.gateway-domain. Then, the user could connect this gateway workload to whichever backend services the user desires, making these backend services accessible through the computed fqdn.
